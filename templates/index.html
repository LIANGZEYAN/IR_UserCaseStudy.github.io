    <h1>Document Relevance Study</h1>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
      <p>In this study, you will be asked to judge the relevance of documents with respect to a search engine query. You will be presented with a query and a set of 9 documents for which you will be asked to select each of the documents that are relevant to the query. For each document that you select as being relevant, you will be asked to highlight the passage of the text in the document that makes it relevant to the query. In total, you will be presented with 26 queries each with 9 candidate documents.</p>
      <p>We expect that to complete this study will take you no more than 30 mins. You may wish to take a short break during this time. The system has a pause button in the top right corner of the following pages. If you take a break during the study, please press the pause button to record that you are having a break. You should press the start button when you recommence.</p>
      <p>Your participation in this study is voluntary and you may withdraw from the study at any time prior to completion for any reason. No personal data will be recorded through the study web pages. The only data that will be recorded relating to your participation in this study is the data the Prolific platform collects and handles.</p>
